# MixUp

Welcome to MixUp, This application allows users to import Spotify playlists and remix/reorder them based on values such as BPM (Beats Per Minute). It's a fun and creative way to customize your music listening experience.

## Motivation

I have a deep passion for music, and my extensive playlists reflect my diverse taste in musical genres. However, during my workouts, I frequently encounter the challenge of tracks with vastly different styles or energy levels, prompting me to constantly skip through songs. Given my inherently lazy nature, I sought to devise a solution. My motivation for this project stems from the desire to create a tool that automatically generates personalized "mixtapes." These mixtapes will be curated based on similar audio features and ordered according to specific preferences, such as arranging tracks from high to low BPM for a soothing "cool down mix" or in high to low intervals for an invigorating "HIIT mix." Additionally, the system will consider the genre of music to ensure a seamless and enjoyable workout experience. This project is driven by my commitment to streamline and enhance the harmony between my music and fitness routines.
